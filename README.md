### Notes

#### Ch 1: Asking Why

- Analyzing art comes down to 2 steps
1.  Describe what you see
2.  Ask why those choices were made (colors, brushstrokes, lighting, sound, characters, cinematography)

- Art doesn't just mean what the artist inteneded, people interpert it as well

### Ch 2: What is the story saying?

- How do we identify primary thems/what it is saying (what is its core idea that it's trying to express?)

- Describe in simple terms the movie and what's happening (main conflicts, how characters, change, major plot beats etc...):
  - I.e. Home alone is about the importance of family
  - Home alone is about learning to take responsibility
  - Home alone is about forgivness


### Ch 3: Visual Storytelling

- Changing distance, colors, etc.. can change meaning
- Mise En Scene: What is in the frame?
- What are the choices being made and how do they impact us? (colors, lighting, framing, distance, characters, etc...)

### Ch 4: Style and Asthetics

- Asthetics are a deliberate choice
- What is the overall style of Realism vs Formalism?
- Pure realism: Recreation of Reality
- Pure Formalism: Doesn't try to recreate reality at all
- Most films are classicism and in the middle has looks of "reality" but elements of music, lighting, angles, etc... that are formalist


### Ch 5: Perspective

- Subjective vs Objective
- Objective: Is it an outside observer with no attachment to the scene/movie?
- Subjective: Uses visual language to depict how a character is feeling/engaging with the world.

### Ch 6: Lenses

- Every lens has a focal length (in mm) lower number = wider, shorter = longer/more focused lens.
- Longer lenses blurs things in the backgoround and are used for closeups.  Really Wide lenses can emphasize motion or even warp the world a bit
- Standard lenses are generally 21mm to 35mm.


### Ch 7: Color

- Lights, Sets, costumes can all have their own colors.
- Colors can represent anything, the filmmakers just need to know how/why to use them
- Warm colors are often comforting, but they can be turned up max and become oppressive though

### Ch 8: Aspect Ratio

- What about the frame itself?
- Aspect ratio: Width to height of the frame/film
- 1.85 to 1 is standard movie and is used to get more in frame and is often used for comedy and gets more environment/characters in the frame
- 16:9 is also a common frame

### Ch 9: Lighting

- Lighting can direct us where to look and tells us where to look
- High key lighting: Creates comforting tone and is well lit
- Low key lighting: Single light source, more shadows, to create stakes/danger

### Ch 10: Character Blocking and Movement

- Blocking: How do characters move in frame and how does the camera move with them?
- Different types of camera movement: Pan (R/L), Tilt (Up/down), Zoom (moves in frame), Tracking (camera moves in space), Crane (Moves through space vertically), Drone/helicopter shot, Handheld/shaky cam
- Regular movment of a camera creates energy and pacing
- When a camera pushes it in it is trying to point out that the thing is important.
- Cowboy shot: Shot of the character from the hips up

### Ch 11: Editing

- Most editing is for continuity to make time/characters feel connected and to help us understand how things interact
- Shifting the editing style can be a major change in the visual language to highlight things
- Cross cutting is something that Nolan does a lot between different storylines to emphasize things that are happening in time
- Crossfade: Commonly used to create dream sequences and memories

### Ch 12: Sound

- There can be cross cuts or there can be blends into something else.  I.e. is it abrupt or subtle?
- Extra layers of sound can be added to emphasize/highlight/exaggerate sounds (Foley sounds)
- Sound design helps set the scenes and exaggerate them
- Sound score/film music can add additional context

### Ch 13: Putting it all together

- What context do we want to view the film in?

### Ch 14: Auteur Theory

- About assigning a primary author to a film and looking at it within a body of work
- The Auteur theory can be a director or an actor (i.e. Tom Hanks in Mission Impossible, or Marvel in the MCU), it adds additional context and themes, perspectives, and ideas.
- Film is a collaborative medium (and a commercial art)
- I.e. Hom alone is another John Hugues movie and fits into John Hughes works and his themes

### Ch 15: Cinema History

- Can be used to understand influences and where elements came from
- I.e. home alone has roots in slapstick comedy and silent films

### Ch 16: Genre

- A way of categorizing films, can be very generic
- A film in one genre may well borrow from another genere (i.e. comedy may borrow from horror)

### Ch 18: Ending

- How we interpret movies will be different from person to person based on our subjective experiences.


### Other Analysis methods

Key Areas of Film Analysis
Mise-en-Scène: Everything you see within the frame of the shot. This includes:
Lighting (how a scene is lit)
Setting (location and décor)
Props (objects with significance)
Costumes and makeup
Actor movement and blocking (how they are positioned and move)
Cinematography: The technical choices behind the camera:
Camera angles (high, low, tilted, etc.)
Shot types (close-up, wide shot, long take, etc.)
Camera movement (pans, zooms, tracking shots, etc.)
Focus (what's sharp, what's blurry)
Editing: How shots are assembled:
Types of cuts (fades, jump cuts, etc.)
Rhythm and pacing of editing
Montage (stringing shots together to create meaning)
Sound: Everything you hear:
Dialogue
Sound effects
Music (both score and existing songs)
Narrative: The story and its construction:
Plot structure
Characters and their development
Themes

Types of Film Analysis
It turns out there are lots of different types of film analysis. So when you're watching something, you have to lock into what you want to talk about.

Here are some directions you could go:

Formalist: Focuses on the technical elements (cinematography, editing, sound, etc.) and how they create meaning.

Narrative: Examines the story, characters, and themes of the film.

Ideological: Looks at how a film reflects or challenges social, political, or cultural ideas.

Psychoanalytic: Explores unconscious desires or symbolism within the film.

Cultural/Historical: Investigates the film within its historical, social, and cultural context.
Summing Up Film Analysis

When it comes to analyzing a film, you can use the stuff in this post to form the basis of your argument.

But at the end of the day, the only way to become a real expert is just to watch a ton of movies and TV shows and go from there.
